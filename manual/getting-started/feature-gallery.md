# Explore the Feature Gallery

The packaged **Examples/FeatureGallery** project gives you four short scenes to
open in the editor and export as standalone games. You can see how each effect is
authored, change it, then compare the result in Play and in the exported game.

Copy the whole gallery folder to a writable location before editing it. Choose
**File → Open project...** and select that copy. Use Content's scene list to open
**Transforms**, **Lighting**, **Physics**, or **Cameras**. The project's `README.md`
gives a short experiment and expected result for each scene.

To export one, open and save that scene. In **Tools → Project Settings**, select
**Use saved current scene as startup** and **Save Settings**. Then use **Run →
Export Game...**, selecting the `runtime-kit` beside the packaged editor and an
output folder outside the project. Run the resulting `forge_game.exe`. Repeat
with another startup scene to export a different demonstration.

The gallery contains ordinary saved project content. It needs neither a C++
compiler nor the optional Developer Kit. The existing [reference game](../reference-game.md)
remains a separate combined gameplay example.
