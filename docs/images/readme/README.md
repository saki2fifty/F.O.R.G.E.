## Native Tile Map render

[Tile Map gallery](tile-maps.png) is a 1280×720 native Game rendering of
`Scenes/74-tile-maps.scene.json` using Linux software Vulkan. It shows the two
actual map instances, shared original arrow image, reflected transform and layer
markers. `tests/tile_gallery_render_tests.hpp` captures this output and checks
projected cell colors at two resolutions. The PPM readback was encoded as lossless
PNG with its pixels and dimensions preserved. Windows execution is a separate gate.

## Native Tile Map authoring controls

[Tile Map authoring](tile-map-authoring.png) preserves the complete 1280×800
Windows D3D12 WARP capture from source
`0b9397cf1852fa1db71f4ddcc9040fdc2984365f`,
[full editor audit](https://github.com/saki2fifty/F.O.R.G.E./actions/runs/39519971030),
artifact `FORGE-Editor-Source-Audit` (`12314486767`), entry
`grid-test-images/tile-editor/tile-document-100.ppm`.
The fixture draws the real Tile Map document, native preview and Inspector using
original Gallery74 data; it stages those two panels rather than recording a
manually operated desktop session. The PPM was encoded as lossless PNG with all
pixels and dimensions preserved. Captures at 100/150/200 percent were visually
reviewed for visible controls, canvas and complete cell-dimension labels.

## Windows editor captures

These are actual FORGE Windows editor captures. The original full-window pixels
and dimensions are preserved; PPM captures were encoded as lossless PNG without
cropping, retouching or generated interface elements.

## Capture sources

**Editor workflows:** source
`1465a511d61257096ae39afc39fecb92e2780c63`, successful
[Windows source audit](https://github.com/saki2fifty/F.O.R.G.E./actions/runs/39084122081),

included in the fully verified Build261018-000190.

**C++ editor and live properties:** source

The captures use D3D12 WARP software rendering. Status-bar timings and diagnostic
counts belong to the validation fixture and its current test stage; they are not
physical graphics-card performance measurements. Some fixture stages retain
diagnostics from intentional failure checks. The small scenes demonstrate editor
workflows rather than finished game artwork. Sample-content attribution remains
in the [Feature Gallery](../../../samples/projects/FeatureGallery/README.md).

## 2D physics Game render

[2D physics](2d-physics-runtime.png) is a lossless PNG encoding of
`grid-test-images/physics-2d/gallery75-tick180-1280.ppm` from full Windows run
39559873949, source `984ce7d61b24c2a70abf79666b0b5be5f2d6bf04`. The actual Game
renderer's six 2D captures passed pixel/pose checks. That candidate's Scene guide
fixture and a separate image-export walkthrough failed, so the whole run is not
accepted. This image documents the qualified Game render only. Original PPM
pixels are unchanged; no generated art, overlays or semantic edits were applied.
