## Transform timeline local validation

The transform animation bundle is implemented and locally validated. Six focused
runtime/regression suites pass under ASan/UBSan. Mouse/keyboard timeline checks
pass at 65/100/200% UI scale, and all eight Gallery scenes preserve their authored
content through the headless editor API. Held keys and nonseamless loops use the
existing presentation snap mechanism; seamless motion stays interpolated.

The Windows-target Gallery clip is published and included by packaging. The
manual, CI selections, exact SDK header fingerprint and content/export adapters
are reconciled. No new Windows ZIP, Windows execution or physical acceptance is
claimed for this bundle.
